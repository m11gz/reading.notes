# Markdown Notes Class 2 #

### What is Markdown? ###
Markdown is a markup language for formatted text using a text editor. 
It's a really easy way of using certain symbols to create different sized fonts, bolding, heading, italization, inserting links and more. 

#### Headings ####
To create your heading you will need to use hastags on the outside of your heading word. #insertheading# with a space in between your first and last word. 
to decrease your heading side you need to use more hastags. For example, ######insert word######

#### Paragraphing ####
This is a really simple one. To create a paragraph you simply use a blank line from your last numbered line of text. 

#### Bold #####
To add emphasis to a word you use **bold**. To bold a text you insert your word in the middle of two asterisks with no spacing in between the asterisks and first 
and last letters of the word. 

#### Italics ####
To italicize a word you use one asterisk in between what you want to italicize with no spacing in between asterisk and letters. *italicize*
