# HTML Basics

What is HTML. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the the structure of your website. It's bare bones markup. A good analogy for what HTML is a skeleton to a body.
It holds everything together. CSS would be what makes the skeleton look aesthetically pleasing.

## Wireframe?

Wireframing is the blueprint of what your website is going to look like. The developer coding it has to have an idea of how the user is going to process the information
Some software you can use if you dont want to do it by hand are, Invision or Balsamiq. Most developers like to do it by hand so it's easier to make changes during the
initial process. Once the prototype is done you can move it to a software to have records of changes.

## Have an idea of the flow of the website

Having a good flow to the website is critical. Whether its a marketing website or a learning website. You need to have a good flow for the user so they are not frustrated
on why the information is jumbled all over the website. It makes it easier to digest information.
