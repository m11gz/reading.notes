# Reading-Notes

My learning journal for Code Fellows!

I’m Miguel Rodriguez (he/him) and I live in Issaquah, WA. I have computer hardware knowledge but no experience with coding or programming. I currently work as a machine operator. I bend metal discs that get welded onto big pipes that turn into huge industrial screws. I currently work on a Windows 10 Pro v. 21H2. I’m excited to start this course so I can finally use my brain opposed to the many zombie like jobs I've had. I'm stoked for the countless possibilities for the future.
