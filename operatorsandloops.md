# What are Loops? 
Loops are a code that make it easy to keep repeating that same code until a conditional is met. 
There are a whole bunch of loops but essentially what they do is the same thing. They repeat the action. 

This here is an example of a loop

for (let step = 1; step < 4; step++) {
  // pace 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Pacing east one step');
